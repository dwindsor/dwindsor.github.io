## About Me

Hi, I'm David Windsor.  I'm a Linux hacker who became interested in
programming computers at an early age when I was given my first computer, a
[Tandy Color Computer 3](http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=109).  I've been using Linux since the late 1990's and became active in open source development a few years later.  I've been involved in the OSS community one way or another since then.
