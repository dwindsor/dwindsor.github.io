title: CISSP Study Methods
---

In terms of strictly professional goals, the past few months have held little else for me aside from studying for and passing the [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/cissp/default.aspx) exam.  I took the exam last Friday and passed.  It was my first attempt.

After the initial excitement of adding some new capital letters to my signature line faded, I realized that I felt a bit cheated.  I feel like experience and common sense contributed vastly more to my passing than anything I memorized while studying.

I studied hard for this exam, and, damn it, I wanted that to pay off. With a weekend’s worth of perspective behind me, I can honestly say that my gut feeling after turning in my exam is very likely true: I don’t think my method of studying did me much good.

### My Recommendation

Read Shon Harris’ entire [CISSP All-In-One Exam Guide](http://www.amazon.com/CISSP-All-One-Guide-Edition/dp/0071781749).  Read the entire thing, all 1400+ pages of it.  The amount of information contained in a comprehensive CISSP study guide is daunting.  Remember, though, there are only so many questions to be asked about each topic.

I wish I could provide more detail on the contents of the exam, but I can’t.  I signed an NDA before taking the exam, and don’t want my credentials pulled.  Good luck, future CISSP test takers.
